# Neuro Tracker

**Neuro Tracker** is a health tool designed to reduce the information gap between
individuals with neurological conditions and their health-care providers.

In general, **Neuro Tracker** has 3 primary goals:

1. Use technology to make it easier to record information that pertains to an
   individuals condition.
2. Aggregate and summarize recorded data, making it easier to share information
   to health-care providers.
3. Provide a seamless experience for all parties involved.

To do so, this project attempts to introduce a highly scalable and maintainable application
developed using AWS technologies and a codebase completely developed using functional programming languages.
