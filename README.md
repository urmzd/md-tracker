# Neuro Tracker

This project was written with the intention of helping individuals with neurological 
impediments track their symptoms, prescriptions and anything else required/suggested 
by their trusted healthcare professionals.

This project was never completed and at its current stage lacks some of the originally intended features,
while other features do not met the bar I put for myself. This was primarly due to time constraints and
a lack of experience. Even with what was said, this project will not be abandoned and in place of it,
a project is being planned out to build a fully functional application with cloud availability.

This README will be updated whenever the next project has began :)
